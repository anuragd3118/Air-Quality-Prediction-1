ABSTRACT
Air Quality Prediction

Air Pollution is one of the most important factors that affects the environment and habitat. Many Metropolitan cities suffer from heavy pollution due to various reasons that have some
serious effects on health, especially children.Air Pollution arises due to bad quality of air that is
polluted by vehicular emissions,Industrial effluents, CO, etc. The objective is to analyze the quality of Air using Machine Learning Algorithms and
Python. The Metric PM2.5 is used for grading the quality of air, The higher the value, the more
the bad quality of air, similarly lower the value the better the quality of air. The Analysis is
performed on collected datasets for extracting some insights. Furthermore, we go on to build a
model that has high accuracy along with good metrics for evaluation.The Algorithms like
Logistic regression and Na√Øve Bayes Classifier were used to predict the Air quality. Once the
model is built we deploy it using IBM Cloud Services(Watson Studio,Node red and Machine
Learning module), So that a user can interact with our model just by giving the parameters and
will end up the PM2.5 value. This PM2.5 value tells whether the air is polluted or not.
